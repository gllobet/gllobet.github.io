I am an IO economist. My research mainly focuses on innovation, how to
optimally design intellectual property rights and patent licensing. In
recent years I have also worked on renewable power sources, its
coexistence with existing technologies, and the upcoming energy
transition. I am board member of
the <a href="https://acco.gencat.cat/ca/inici/index.html">Catalan
Competition Commission</a>.
